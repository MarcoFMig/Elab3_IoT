The water level monitoring subsystem is responsible for continuously monitoring the level of the water, by means of the sonar.
The water level is sampled and sent to the River Monitor Service with some  frequency F 
This frequency depends on the state of the system and is established by the River Monitoring Service (see later).
When the system is working correctly (network ok, sending data ok)  the green led is on and the red is off; otherwise:
 – in the case of network problems
 – the red led should be on and the green led off.
